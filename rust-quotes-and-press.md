A few thoughts on Fuchsia security

- https://blog.cr0.org/2021/06/a-few-thoughts-on-fuchsia-security.html
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27487465

"For system-level folks, Rust is one of the most exciting security developments of the past few decades. It elegantly solves problems which smart people were saying could not be solved. Fuchsia has a lot of code, and we made sure that much of it (millions of LoC) was in Rust.

Our kernel, Zircon, is not in Rust. Not yet anyway. But it is in a nice, lean subset of C++ which I consider a vast improvement over C."

"Hi, I think rust is just an amazing achievement because it is the
first time we all, just about the first time we've seen one of these
kind of linear or affine type systems actually make its way into
practical use. So its just incredible, well done! I'm, you know, I
mean I'm wild with envy. I want to steal all the best ideas I can and
put them in Haskell."

"The dev-environment-setup experience with Rust is amazing. The Rust

system. One thing currently missing from Rust is first class support
for higher-kinded types (HKT), which, to be honest, I don‚Äôt miss too

continuing to make my games in Rust for the foreseeable future1;
however, I can‚Äôt strongly recommend Rust for gamedev in the near-term,
especially if you‚Äôre hoping for a batteries included experience."

> "Beyond the ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù contained in Rust (e.g. the ownership model),
the ‚Äúsmall ideas‚Äù that most other systems-y language don‚Äôt contain
(Option, Result, Iterator, discriminated unions, pattern matching,
etc. etc. etc.) make minute-to-minute programming much nicer."

> "Holy cow are the compiler error messages generally fantastic. rustc
  seems like a friend who‚Äôs trying to help you write better code,
  rather than a gatekeeper working to slow you down."

> "Rather than being locked into one paradigm, I found myself being
  able to cleanly use different programming styles as warranted in
  different situations."

> Stable upgrades have been a breeze, and the release train has been
  very nice. 8 new versions of Rust were released during the
  development of A Snake‚Äôs Tale, and each upgrade took no more than a
  few minutes. The release train has also consistently delivered
  much-welcomed improvements.

> Rust code being platform independent by default is üòçüòçüòç. There are no
  source level differences between my Mac, Windows, and Linux builds3,
  and the differences between mobile and desktop are relatively small
  and focused mostly around the UI delta between touchscreen and
  mouse+keyboard and OpenGL vs OpenGL ES.

"I really love seeing articles like this come out about Rust.

It's language design the way it should be: incorporating the cutting
edge ideas from academia while still striving to cater to beginners;
drawing on the strengths of other languages communities to build out
good library and solutions to package management; designing everything
in the open, and constantly seeking feedback from their users.

It's a great blend of theoretical CS, HCI, computer systems, and
application development, and it's always fun to hear about what
they're up to."

"In brief, Rust was a joy to work with. Its powerful pattern matching
made writing compiler optimization rules very easy, and we found that
code that compiled usually ‚Äújust worked‚Äù because of the stringent
checks Rust‚Äôs own compiler performs on code the programmer
writes. Additionally, writing C APIs in Rust was also very easy; Rust
provides good support and documentation for doing this. While there
are a few features the Rust developers are working on which we hope
appear in the stable compiler soon (namely, incremental compilation
and the box keyword), we wholeheartedly reccomend Rust to those
looking for a fun, powerful programming language for their next
project."

"I use Rust (since ~9-10months) and C++ (since ~7 years) at work, both

C++, implementing new features in both (the C++ part is not "legacy"
code or anything, it is just that new modules are written in Rust, but
the "old" ones are still being developed).

The jump from C++ to Rust is qualitatively larger and better in
benefits than the jump from C to C++. Still, trying to sell Rust to
C++ programmers is as hard as trying to sell C++ to C programmers.

"One of the biggest overall gainers of any of the measured languages,
Rust leaped from 47 on our board to 26 ‚Äì one spot behind Visual
Basic. This comes two quarters after the language not only stalled,
but actually gave up ground in our last rankings. What a difference a
few months can make. By our metrics, Rust went from the 46th most

result of the new process, of course, but no other language grew
faster."

"I recently wrote an MPEG-2 subtitle decoder in Rust, and spent my
weekend attacking it with cargo fuzz. The fuzzer ran over a billion
sample inputs through my code.

"I discovered:

  - No malloc/free-related errors, thanks to the borrow checker.
  - 3 errors where I constructed invalid Range objects. These might
    have been exploitable or resulted in infinite loops in C.
  - One arithmetic underflow error, which might have been exploitable
    if it weren't for Rust's bounds checking.

So while writing high risk code, Rust ruled out most errors at compile
time, and caught 4 more at run time. Up until now I had underrated
Rust's runtime checks as part of the overall security story, but I now
consider them as indispensable as the compile time checks."

implementation from reading the Rust RFCs [1], especially those

08:45 <&steveklabnik> The Rust programing language fits the bill perfectly: it‚Äôs a language that promises memory safety without garbage collection, concurrency without data races,
                      and abstractions without overhead. It also has sufficient performance for our needs. That means that code written in Rust has the same memory requirements as
                      the equivalent code written in C. At Dropbox, many of our services are actually memory bound, so this is a key advantage over a garbag

> It's interesting, because this article - the whole theme of it - was inspired by the Rust and Servo community. They regularly have "This week in Rust" and "This week in Servo" posts to inform the community of the progress. And let me tell you, these are extremely valuable in keeping the community up to date and engaged. It's proven to be such a successful model that other libraries in the Rust community, and outside of it have started to make their own posts like this.

I'm currently working on a contract where we're trying to fixup some code that crashes under heavy load, as well as troubleshoot some perf issues.

Except no one is sure exactly how long the lifetime is on these things. So everyone copies everything just to be sure. Rust would force addressing this kinda thing up front.

[Discussion of 30-minute introduction (good rationalization of breakage)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7968556).

> "Mozilla is one of my favorite tech companies. Servo is a great example: Mozilla is willing to engage in fundamental CS research. Not only are they trying to put together a parallel, secure browser engine from the ground up, but they even created Rust to do so. This is truly long-term work, which seems rare in an increasingly short-term world."

> "And Rust isn't just another C clone with OOP or CSP bolted on: it's principled, relatively elegant and takes full advantage of the last few decades of PL research. All while being practical‚Äîit has to be, since it's evolved with a Servo as a concomitant project. A non-trivial companion project like that seems great for naturally guiding a language! Not many other languages can say any of this, much less ones actually poised to replace C++ or at least do actual systems programming."

> "And Mozilla is doing all this in a completely open and transparent way. I think this is incredibly important: anybody can get a glimpse into active development or even contribute. Just go to the relevant GitHub repo[1][2] and you're set. This is the way open source is supposed to work, rather than having companies develop behind close doors and dump source code occasionally (although that's also better than nothing)."
